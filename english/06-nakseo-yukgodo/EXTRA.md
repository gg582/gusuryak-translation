# Advanced Algebraic & Structural Properties Discovered During Solver Exploration (EXTRA.md)

## 1. Overview

This document records the **deep algebraic properties** and **structural invariants** discovered during the development and exploration of deterministic solvers, Z3 SMT mining, and group-theoretic analysis for **Nakseo Yukgodo (洛書六觚圖)** from Choi Seok-jeong's *Gusuryak*. These mathematical findings perfectly harmonize with the historical annotations and geometric figures in the original manuscript.

## 2. Six Key Discovered Mathematical Properties

### 1. Perfect Antipodal Wedge & Ray Pair Sum Invariant
- **Antipodal Wedge Pair Identity**:
  The sum of any pair of opposing $60^\circ$ wedge sectors $W_i$ and $W_{i+3}$ (45 cells each) is **always exactly $12,195$ ($45 \times 271$)**, regardless of which opposite pair is chosen:
  $$W_i + W_{i+3} = 12195 \quad (i=0, 1, 2)$$
  *Even though individual wedge sums alternate between $6097$ and $6098$ due to the odd cell count, combining any antipodal wedge pair completely cancels out the parity discrepancy ($6097 + 6098 = 12195$).*

- **Antipodal Ray Pair Identity**:
  Similarly, the sum of any opposing ray pair $R_r$ and $R_{r+3}$ (9 cells each) is **always exactly $2,439$ ($9 \times 271$)**:
  $$R_r + R_{r+3} = 2439 \quad (r=0, 1, 2)$$

### 2. Opposite Side Pair Sum Identity ($2710 = 10 \times 271$)
- The sum of cells along any opposing pair of outer perimeter sides $S_j$ and $S_{j+3}$ (10 cells each) is **always exactly $2,710$**:
  $$S_j + S_{j+3} = 2710 \quad (j=0, 1, 2)$$
- This guarantees that each individual side achieves the target sum of **$1355$ ($5 \times 271$)** under symmetric lower-bound equilibrium.

---

### 3. Corner Antipodal Pair Identity
- The values assigned to the 6 outer corner cells $C_0, C_1, \dots, C_5$ always form **exact antipodal complementary pairs summing to 271**:
  $$v(C_k) + v(C_{k+3}) = 271 \quad (k=0, 1, 2)$$
- Consequently, the total sum of all 6 corner cells is invariant: $\sum_{k=0}^5 v(C_k) = 813$ ($3 \times 271$).

### 4. Ring Sum-of-Squares Claim Falsified (Not an Invariant)
- The previous claim that each ring has a fixed sum-of-squares constant
  $\sum_{c \in \text{Ring}_k} v(c)^2 = \text{Const}_k$ is **false**.
- Empirical verification over all 12 validated orbit families produced multiple different values per ring, so this quantity is **not orbit-invariant**.
- Therefore, ring sum-of-squares must **not** be used as a hard SMT/Z3 constraint; doing so can incorrectly eliminate valid solutions.

---

### 5. Parity Split of 135 Antipodal Pairs
- Among the numbers 1..270, the odd and even numbers split 100% symmetrically across antipodal slots $(c, -c)$: if one side is odd, the opposite MUST be even.
- This is a direct arithmetic consequence of $v(c) + v(-c) = 271$ (odd).
- Across all 135 antipodal slot pairs $(c, -c)$, **exactly one cell contains an odd number and the other contains an even number** with 100% precision.
- Since $v(c) + v(-c) = 271$ (an odd number), the combination of (Odd + Odd = Even) or (Even + Even = Even) is arithmetically impossible.

## 3. Conclusion

These findings show that Nakseo Yukgodo is a highly structured geometric algebra system embodying **antipodal complementarity ($271$), $C_6$ rotational symmetry, and strict arithmetic parity partitioning**. In practice, linear antipodal pair identities are robust constraints, while ring sum-of-squares is not.
